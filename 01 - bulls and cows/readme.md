# Project 1. Bulls and Cows

The computer generates a number consisting of several unique digits (from 3 to 6). The player is given several attempts to guess this number.

After each attempt, the computer reports the number of matching digits in wrong positions, as well as the number of correct digits in their correct positions.

For example, the secret number: 56478, player's guess: 52976

Answer: digits in wrong positions - 1 (6), digits in correct positions - 2 (5 and 7)

The game continues until the number of turns runs out or until the number is guessed.

By the way, in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 4, a very similar mini-game is used for hacking terminals.
